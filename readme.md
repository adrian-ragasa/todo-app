## Prerequisites
The Ionic command-line interface (CLI) is the go-to tool for developing Ionic apps.

* Run `npm install -g @ionic/cli` to install ionic CLI.

## Start the project
The project is started with the regular ionic commands.

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `ionic serve` to start the development environment.
3. To build the project run `ionic build android` or `ionic build ios`. In order for you to build an iOS app, you need to run on MacOS.

An alternative is to emulate the app on a device or upload it to the ionic cloud. From here you can download the ionic view app and use the app on all devices.

## AppCenter
